# Eclipse OpenJ9 website redesign project

The **vnext** branch contains the source for a new design of the OpenJ9 website, which is being developed with the Gatsby.js static site generator 
and the React.js Javascript library.

The draft website is published to the [gh-pages site](https://eclipse.github.io/openj9-website/) for this repository from the **gh-pages** branch.

For more information about the design and the progress of this project, see the [OpenJ9 website redesign epic](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9-website/issues/182
).

The current website can be found [here](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/).
