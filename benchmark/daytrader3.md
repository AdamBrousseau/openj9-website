DayTrader 3 performance testing
===============================

This experiment was designed to determine how well an OpenJDK V9 built with Eclipse OpenJ9 performs against an OpenJDK V9 built with HotSpot.

## Benchmark setup

Detailed information about the hardware systems, software, and configuration settings that were used for this experiment.

**System under test:**
- Desktop machine using one Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz
-	16GB RAM
-	HyperThreading enabled, yielding 8 hardware threads.
-	CentOS 7.3 operating system


**Benchmark application:**

Tests were performed using the [DayTrader 3  application](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader3), which models an online stock trading system. DayTrader 3 was installed on top of
[OpenLiberty](http://openliberty.io/downloads). However, due to a missing dependency, the public version of OpenLiberty is not capable of running DayTrader 3 with Java 9. This dependency, the ASM V6 library, which provides low-level bytecode manipulation capabilities, is expected to be included soon. For this experiment we used a private version of OpenLiberty with a beta version of ASM V6.

**OpenJDK binaries:**

For the performance comparison, the following JDKs were obtained from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net):


- OpenJDK9 with OpenJ9 (OpenJDK9-OPENJ9_x64_Linux_20172509 build) with the following version information:
```
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9-internal+0-adhoc.jenkins.openjdk)
Eclipse OpenJ9 VM (build 2.9, JRE 9 Linux amd64-64 Compressed References 20170925_14 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)
J9VM - 291a949
JIT  - 291a949
OMR  - 3271be8
OpenJDK  - a3670d2 based on jdk-9+181)
```
- OpenJDK9 with Hotspot (OpenJDK9_x64_Linux_20172509 build) with the following version information:
```
openjdk version "9-internal"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9-internal+0-adhoc.jenkins.openjdk)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 9-internal+0-adhoc.jenkins.openjdk, mixed mode)
```

**Test environment:**

- The persistence layer was ensured by **Db2**, which was running on a separate machine.
- The workload generator, **JMeter**, was set up on a further machine.
- The two machines were connected to the system under test by 10 GB Ethernet.

## Test process

This section covers how the tests were performed and interpreted.

- For ramp up curves, which illustrate application throughput, the load is applied continuously for 30 minutes using 50 jmeter threads.
-	For startup experiments, the startup time is the time needed for OpenLiberty to print "Liberty is ready to run a smarter planet". At this point, there is no load applied to the system.
-	The reported footprint is the Resident Set Size (RSS) of the Java process, as reported by Linux with the command: `ps  -orss --no-headers â€“pid -JvmPid`
-	For ramp up curves, footprint values are read periodically, every 10 seconds.
-	For startup experiments, the footprint values are read just after OpenLiberty has finished starting up.
-	For startup experiments, the JVM was pinned to 4 hardware threads residing on 2 cores; for ramp up experiments, the JVM was pinned to 4 hardware threads residing on 4 different cores.

Additional runs were performed for OpenJDK9 with OpenJ9 with additional JVM tuning parameters:

1.	Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) enabled: Options `-Xshareclasses -Xscmx60M -Xscmaxaot8M`
2.	AOT and JIT compiler optimizations: Options `-Xshareclasses -Xscmx60M -Xscmaxaot8M -Xquickstart`

When AOT was enabled, the values set reflect the default settings in OpenLiberty.


## Benchmark results



### Footprint during ramp up

**Figure.1** DayTrader 3 footprint size during ramp up with a maximum Java heap size set to 1 GB. Comparison between **OpenJDK 9 with Hotspot** and **OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9**.

In all three scenarios, memory footprint (Resident Set Size) increased abruptly when load was applied to the system (time = 0), but more or less settled after about 3 minutes. OpenJDK with HotSpot was found to use approximately 80% more physical memory than OpenJDK with OpenJ9. Enabling AOT on the OpenJ9 VM made almost no difference to the results.

### Footprint after startup

**Figure 2.** DayTrader 3 footprint after startup with a maximum Java heap size set to 1 GB. Comparison between **OpenJDK 9 with Hotspot** and **OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9**.

Immediately after startup OpenJ9 shows a footprint size of around 60% less than Hotspot. When OpenJ9 was tested with AOT enabled, and with AOT and -Xquickstart enabled, the footprint size remained at around 60% less than Hotspot.

### Startup time

**Figure 3.** DayTrader 3 startup time with a maximum Java heap size set to 1 GB. Comparison between **OpenJDK 9 with Hotspot** and **OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9**.

With no command line options OpenJ9 shows a slightly longer startup time than Hotspot. However, with AOT enabled, startup time for OpenJ9 is almost 40% lower than Hotspot. Moreover, with AOT enabled and -Xquickstart, startup time for OpenJ9 is almost 50% lower than Hotspot.

### Throughput

**Figure 4.** DayTrader 3 throughput during ramp up with a maximum Java heap size set to 1 GB. Comparison between **OpenJDK 9 with Hotspot** and **OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9**.

Although both OpenJ9 and Hotspot reach a similar peak throughput, OpenJ9 reaches the peak about 7 minutes faster. The small amount of AOT code (8 MB) does not make a difference in this case. 

## Conclusion

While the specific levels of performance shown in the graphs above might change from benchmark to benchmark or even from machine to machine, the same trends are expected to hold for a large class of server type applications. 

OpenJ9 achieves a good balance between (often conflicting) performance metrics. As seen above, it offers excellent footprint savings and faster start-up time with the help of AOT technology while also delivering throughput performance that is competitive with Hotspot.

Due to its low memory footprint, OpenJ9 is particularly well suited for cloud computing environments where memory savings translate into cost savings for cloud users and providers alike.
